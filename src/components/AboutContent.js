    const bio = `Hey there! I'm Nicole, breaking barriers as the first in my family to earn a STEM degree. Graduating Magna Cum Laude in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science was a pivotal moment, solidifying my dedication to crafting solutions in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
    As an advocate for diversity in tech, Iâ€™m a proud member of organizations like SWE and RTC. My mission extends beyond coding; I aspire to bridge the gender gap by inspiring the next generation of women in engineering. It's not just about writing code; it's about fostering an inclusive tech community.`
